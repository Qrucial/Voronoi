Voronoi uses Substrate which is a next-generation framework for blockchain innovation ðŸš€.

See /frame/voronoi_ecdsa for code details. State: under heavy development.

ToDo list:
- [X] Initiating project, creating draft topologies
- [x] Create beta plans and repositories
- [X] Implement the core of ECDSA signing and verification (non-threshold for now)
- [ ] Indepth tests with Rust X Solidity ECDSA signing logic
- [ ] Improve how private keys are stored on nodes
- [ ] HTTPS API for sign requests (ongoing)
- [ ] HTTPS API to check signatures and balances
- [ ] VRN token for balances and logic for deduction
- [ ] HTTPS API and VRN token glue
- [ ] Voronoi public keys storage
- [ ] Frontend that connects with polkadotjs or metamask

## Contributions & Code of Conduct

Please follow the contributions guidelines as outlined in [`docs/CONTRIBUTING.adoc`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.adoc). In all communications and contributions, this project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Security

The security policy and procedures can be found in [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).

## License

- Substrate Primitives (`sp-*`), Frame (`frame-*`) and the pallets (`pallets-*`), binaries (`/bin`) and all other utilities are licensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE-APACHE2).
- Substrate Client (`/client/*` / `sc-*`) is licensed under [GPL v3.0 with a classpath linking exception](LICENSE-GPL3).

The reason for the split-licensing is to ensure that for the vast majority of teams using Substrate to create feature-chains, then all changes can be made entirely in Apache2-licensed code, allowing teams full freedom over what and how they release and giving licensing clarity to commercial teams.

In the interests of the community, we require any deeper improvements made to Substrate's core logic (e.g. Substrate's internal consensus, crypto or database code) to be contributed back so everyone can benefit.
